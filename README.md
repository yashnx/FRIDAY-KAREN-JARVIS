# FRIDAY-KAREN-JARVIS

This project involves the development of a voice assistant using the Python programming language. The voice assistant serves as a prototype implementation of an AI assistant, which utilizes a table-based model approach.
The table-based model approach works by creating a table that contains specific user commands and their corresponding responses. The voice assistant uses this table to identify and interpret user commands, providing relevant responses accordingly. This approach ensures that the voice assistant is highly customizable and can be tailored to meet specific user requirements.
